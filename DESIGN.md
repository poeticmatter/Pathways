## Game Overview

Card Pathways is a solo spatial puzzle. The player navigates a 5×5 map by playing cards from a hand onto adjacent cells. The goal is to reach the exit at the top-right from the entrance at the bottom-left.

Exactly one card is physically present on the map at all times. All other cells hold only their remembered tile state.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Map | 5×5 grid of cells |
| Deck | 10 fixed-design cards, shuffled at start |
| Card grid | 9×9 sub-cells (3×3 logical sub-cells, each 3 px wide in grid space) |
| Map tile grid | 3×3 sub-cells, displayed through the card's center hole |
| Cards on map | Exactly 1 at all times |

## Coordinate System

Map coordinates are `(Col, Row)`, 0-indexed, **origin at top-left**.

```
Col →  0    1    2    3    4
Row
 0                          ← EXIT (4,0)
 1
 2          (2,2) = RESHUFFLE
 3
 4  ← ENTRY (0,4)
```

- Entry cell: `(0, 4)` — player enters from the **left** edge
- Exit cell: `(4, 0)` — player wins by reaching this cell with a path exiting **right** or **top**
- Reshuffle cell: `(2, 2)` — map tile at center triggers a reshuffle when reached

Sub-cell coordinates within a card or tile are `(subCol, subRow)`, 0-indexed, origin top-left.
The entry/exit edge midpoints on a 9×9 card grid are:
- Left: `(0, 4)` | Right: `(8, 4)` | Top: `(4, 0)` | Bottom: `(4, 8)`

## Core Types

These are the canonical type definitions. Code must match these exactly.

```csharp
enum SubCell { Blocked, Passable, Hole, Door, Key, Shuffle }

enum Direction { Top, Right, Bottom, Left }

record struct MapCoord(int Col, int Row);
record struct SubCoord(int Col, int Row);  // within a 9×9 or 3×3 grid

// A card is a fixed 9×9 design. Cards are templates — they carry no mutable state.
class CardDefinition
{
    int Id;
    int HandSize;
    SubCell[,] Grid;  // [row, col], 9×9
}

// A map tile holds the persistent mutable state for one cell.
// State is stored here, never on cards.
class MapTile
{
    int DefinitionId;
    SubCell[,] Grid;  // [row, col], 3×3 — mutated as doors open, keys used
}

// Snapshot of a card placed on a tile, after all interactions are resolved.
// Produced by GameLogic.ResolvePlacement — never mutated after creation.
record PlacementResult(
    MapTile ModifiedTile,
    SubCell[,] ModifiedCardGrid,  // 9×9, keys/doors consumed
    HashSet<SubCoord> Reachable,
    bool TriggeredReshuffle
);

enum GameStatus { Playing, Won, Lost }

class GameState
{
    MapTile[,] Map;              // [row, col], 5×5
    List<CardDefinition> Deck;
    List<CardDefinition> Hand;
    List<CardDefinition> Discard;
    MapCoord CurrentCell;
    Direction EntryEdge;
    SubCell[,] ActiveCardGrid;   // 9×9 — current card after interaction
    HashSet<SubCoord> Reachable;
    GameStatus Status;
}
```

---

## Composite Grid

The composite grid is a 9×9 array used for reachability computation only — it is never stored.

Construction:
1. Start with the active card's 9×9 grid.
2. Overwrite cells `[row+3, col+3]` for row/col in 0..2 with the map tile's 3×3 grid.

The center 3×3 region (`rows 3–5, cols 3–5`) always reflects map tile state. Card state fills the surrounding 6×3 border area.

---

## Reachability Algorithm

Input: composite 9×9 grid, entry `Direction`.  
Output: `HashSet<SubCoord>` of reachable sub-cells.

Entry point by direction:
- Left → `(0, 4)` | Right → `(8, 4)` | Top → `(4, 0)` | Bottom → `(4, 8)`

BFS rules:
- A cell is walkable if its value is `Passable`, `Key`, or `Shuffle`.
- `Door` cells are collected but **not** traversed; they mark blocked thresholds.
- `Blocked` and `Hole` cells stop traversal.
- If the entry point itself is not walkable, the result is an empty set.

---

## Interaction Resolution

After a card is placed, interactions are resolved in a fixpoint loop:

```
repeat:
    composite = BuildCompositeGrid(tile, cardGrid)
    result    = ComputeReachability(composite, entryEdge)
    
    if result.Keys.Count > 0 AND result.Doors.Count > 0:
        consume min(keys, doors) pairs — set each sub-cell to Passable
        (update tile or cardGrid depending on which grid the sub-cell belongs to)
        changed = true
    
    if result.Shuffles contains any cell still == Shuffle:
        set that sub-cell to Passable in whichever grid owns it
        didShuffle = true
        changed = true
until not changed
```

A sub-cell belongs to the tile if `subRow` ∈ [3,5] and `subCol` ∈ [3,5]; otherwise it belongs to the card.

Key-door pairing is positional: pair `keys[0]` with `doors[0]`, etc. Order within the BFS result is insertion order (queue order).

Each card and tile holds at most one special cell (Key, Door, or Shuffle), so at most one pair is consumed per resolution pass. The `min(keys, doors)` loop handles the general case but will never consume more than one pair in practice.

## Turn Structure

Each turn executes these steps exactly, in order:

1. **Play card** — player selects a card from hand and a valid adjacent cell.
2. **Resolve placement** — call `ResolvePlacement(tile, card, entryEdge)` → `PlacementResult`.
3. **Update map** — write `PlacementResult.ModifiedTile` into `Map[row, col]`.
4. **Discard old card** — add the previously active card to `Discard` (skip if it is the start card, id = 0).
5. **Apply reshuffle** — if `PlacementResult.TriggeredReshuffle`, shuffle `Discard` into `Deck`, clear `Discard`.
6. **Normalize hand** — remove played card from hand, then draw from `Deck` until `Hand.Count == newCard.HandSize`. If `Hand.Count` exceeds `HandSize`, discard the excess.
7. **Check win** — if new cell is `(4, 0)` and `Reachable` contains `(4, 0)` (top exit) or `(8, 4)` (right exit) → `Status = Won`.
8. **Check loss** — if `Hand.Count == 0` and `Deck.Count == 0` → `Status = Lost`.

**Hand invariant:** After every turn, `Hand.Count == ActiveCard.HandSize`, unless the deck ran dry.

## Valid Move Rules

A cell `(targetCol, targetRow)` is a valid destination for a selected card if all of:
1. It is orthogonally adjacent to `CurrentCell`.
2. The current card's reachable set includes the exit sub-cell facing `targetCell`.
3. The candidate card's grid has `Passable` at the entry sub-cell facing back toward `CurrentCell`.
4. The target cell is within map bounds (0–4 for both axes).

Exit sub-cells (on the current 9×9 card) facing each direction:
- Right → `(8, 4)` | Left → `(0, 4)` | Up (row-1) → `(4, 0)` | Down (row+1) → `(4, 8)`

Entry sub-cells (on the candidate card) are the mirror:
- Moving right → candidate must have `Passable` at `(0, 4)` (left edge)
- Moving left → `(8, 4)` | Moving up → `(4, 8)` | Moving down → `(4, 0)`

## Card Data

Cards are fixed templates loaded from JSON at startup. Card grids are 9×9 with the center 3×3 set to `Hole`. They carry no mutable state — mutations during interaction resolution are applied to a local copy, never to the definition.

The **start card** (id 0) is a special template placed at `(0, 4)` at game start. It is never shuffled into the deck and never discarded (skip step 4 when the id is 0).

---

## Map Tile Data

Map tiles are 3×3 grids. At game start:
- 24 standard tiles are shuffled and assigned to all cells except `(2, 2)`.
- The reshuffle tile (the one with a `Shuffle` sub-cell at its center) is always placed at `(2, 2)`.

Each tile's mutable state is a deep copy — tiles share no data between cells.

---

## Modules

The codebase is organized into these layers. Each layer may only depend on layers below it.

```
Rendering   (Raylib-cs calls, input, draw calls)
    ↓
Game        (GameState, turn execution, input dispatch)
    ↓
Logic       (pure functions: ReachabilityMap, ResolvePlacement, ValidMoves)
    ↓
Data        (CardDefinition, MapTile, enums — no behavior)
```

**Rules:**
- `Logic` has zero Raylib dependencies and zero side effects. All functions are pure and testable in isolation.
- `Game` owns the single mutable `GameState`. No other layer mutates it.
- `Rendering` reads game state through `IReadOnlyGameState` and produces draw calls. It dispatches player actions through `GameController` methods — it never mutates `GameState` directly.
- `Data` defines types and loads/parses static JSON definitions. No game logic here.

---

## Rendering Conventions

- Window resolution: 1280×720 (16:9), resizable with layout reflow.
- Map panel: left side. Hand panel: right side.
- Map cells scale uniformly; sub-cells render as small squares.
- Current cell highlights the composite grid with reachability tint.
- Non-current cells show only their map tile's center 3×3 region.
- Valid move targets are highlighted when a card is selected.
- Colors and visual style are thematic (dark background, glowing paths).
- After a win or loss, pressing **R** restarts the game.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Card rotation
- Multiple players
- Scoring / move counter
- Traversal-based rules
- Card special abilities beyond door/key/shuffle
- Procedural map/card generation
- Undo / redo
- Visible discard pile
- Timer
- Networking
- Save/load
